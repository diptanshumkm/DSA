/*
    ----------------------------------------Rules of Abstract Classes & Methods----------------------------------------------------
    
    1Ô∏è‚É£ An abstract class cannot be instantiated (cannot create an object of it).
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Can have constructors to initialize variables in subclasses.
    3Ô∏è‚É£ Can contain both abstract and concrete (normal) methods.
    4Ô∏è‚É£ At least one abstract method is required to make a class abstract.
    5Ô∏è‚É£ Child class must override all abstract methods, otherwise, it must also be declared abstract.
    6Ô∏è‚É£ Cannot have private or static abstract methods since abstract methods must be overridden.
    7Ô∏è‚É£ Can have final methods, but those cannot be overridden in child classes.
    8Ô∏è‚É£ Abstract methods must be declared inside an abstract class (cannot exist in a normal class).
    9Ô∏è‚É£ Can extend another abstract class and inherit its abstract methods.
    üîü Can implement interfaces along with defining abstract methods.
    

    Access Modifier	                 Allowed?	                 Explanation
       public	                     ‚úÖ Yes	                    Abstract methods can be public and must be overridden in child classes.
       protected	                 ‚úÖ Yes	                    Can be accessed by child classes within the same package or through inheritance.
       private	                     ‚ùå No	                    Not allowed because abstract methods must be overridden, and private methods are not accessible in child classes.
       static	                     ‚ùå No	                    Abstract methods require overriding, but static methods belong to the class and cannot be overridden.
